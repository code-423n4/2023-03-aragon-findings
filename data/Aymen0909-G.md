| 1  | State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`  | 11 |
| 2  | Use `unchecked` blocks to save gas  |  2 |
| 3  | `storage` variable should be cached into `memory` variables instead of re-reading them  |  8 |

## Findings

### 1- State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable` :

The state variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`, this avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (100 gas) with a PUSH32 (3 gas).

### 2- Use `unchecked` blocks to save gas :

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block.

File: AddresslistVoting.sol [Line 168-174](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-aragon/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/majority-voting/addresslist/AddresslistVoting.sol#L168-L174)
```
if (_voteOption == VoteOption.Yes) {
    proposal_.tally.yes = proposal_.tally.yes + 1;
} else if (_voteOption == VoteOption.No) {
    proposal_.tally.no = proposal_.tally.no + 1;
} else if (_voteOption == VoteOption.Abstain) {
    proposal_.tally.abstain = proposal_.tally.abstain + 1;
}
```

In the code linked above all the increment operations cannot realistically overflow as they represent users votes where each users only gives 1 votes, so they should be marked as `unchecked`.

```
uint64 snapshotBlock = block.number.toUint64() - 1;
```

In the code linked above the operation cannot underflow as the `block.number` value will always be greater than 1 so they should be marked as `unchecked`. 


### 3- `storage` variable should be cached into `memory` variables instead of re-reading them :

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function, the caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read, thus saves **100gas** for each instance.

### 4- `x += y/x -= y` costs more gas than `x = x + y/x = x - y` for state variables :

Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **113 gas** as explained [here](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8)
