[G1] Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-aragon/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/framework/plugin/repo/PluginRepo.sol

   struct Tag {
        uint8 release;
        uint16 build;
    }


    mapping(uint8 => uint16) internal buildsPerRelease;
    uint8 public latestRelease


When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contracts gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

Use a larger size then downcast where needed

[G2]Use nested if and, avoid multiple check combinations
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-aragon/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/token/ERC20/governance/GovernanceERC20.sol

if (to != address(0) && numCheckpoints(to) == 0 && delegates(to) == address(0)) {
            _delegate(to, to);
        }

[G3]Setting the constructor to payable

 constructor(IERC20Upgradeable _token, string memory _name, string memory _symbol) {
        initialize(_token, _name, _symbol);
    }

You can cut out 10 opcodes in the creation-time EVM bytecode if you declare a constructor payable. Making the constructor payable eliminates the need for an initial check of msg.value == 0 and saves 13 gas on deployment with no security risks
