### [L-01] Missing event emission on setter function

File: `CounterV2.sol`

`setNewVariable` is missing event emission which might not be good for off-chain monitoring. Emit an event on state change.

### [NC-01] Contract layoyt and order of function

File: `MajorityVotingBase.sol`

The Solidity style guide recommends declaring internal functions below external functions. If possible, consider adding internal functions below external functions for the contract layout. Furthermore, itâ€™s also recommended to declare pure and view functions at the end of a grouping. Also It is a best practice that custom errors, structs and events are declared in the interface not in the implementation contract.

### [NC-02] Unused import and custom error

`IProposal` import is not unused and can be removed

### [NC-03] Typos in the comments

File: `MajorityVotingBase.sol`

` /// @param VoteReplacment` -> ` /// @param VoteReplacement`

`proposa` -> `proposal`

`comparision` -> `comparison`

File: `PluginSetupProcessor.sol`

`inidcated` -> `indicated`

### [NC-04] Functions are missing `override` keyword

Functions from `IMajorityVotingBase.sol`  that are declared in its implementation `MajorityVotingBase.sol` are missing override keyword. Consider adding it.
