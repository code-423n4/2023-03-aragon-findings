### [G-1] Optimize names to save gas

public/external function names and public member variable names can be optimized to save gas. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save 128 gas each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save 22 gas per call, per [sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

### [G-2]  ++I/I++ OR --I/I-- SHOULD BE UNCHECKED{++I}/UNCHECKED{I++} OR  UNCHECKED{--I}/UNCHECKED{I--}WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, AS IS THE CASE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop

### [GAS-3] EXPRESSIONS FOR CONSTANT VALUES SUCH AS A CALL TO KECCAK256(), SHOULD USE IMMUTABLE RATHER THAN CONSTANT

Using immutable for constant expressions such as a call to keccak256() means that the expression is evaluated at deployment time and the result is stored in the contract's storage. This results in a smaller bytecode size and lower deployment costs, as the compiler does not have to evaluate the expression every time the contract is compiled

When a constant expression is evaluated at runtime, it takes up more gas than when the same expression is evaluated at deployment time and the result is simply read from the contract's storage

using immutable for constant expressions such as a call to keccak256() can save gas and reduce the deployment costs of your smart contract

### [G-5] 

In Solidity, declaring a variable inside a loop can result in higher gas costs compared to declaring it outside the loop. This is because every time the loop runs, a new instance of the variable is created, which can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and increased gas costs

On the other hand, if you declare a variable outside the loop, the variable is only initialized once, and you can reuse the same instance of the variable inside the loop. This approach can save gas and optimize the execution of your code

GAS SAMPLE TEST IN remix ide(Without gas optimizations) :

Before Mitigation :

     function testGas() public view {

        for(uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          address collateral = msg.sender;
          address  collateral1 = msg.sender;
            
        }

The execution Cost : 2176 

After Mitigation :

     function testGas() public view {
    address collateral; address  collateral1;
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
         collateral = msg.sender;
         collateral1 = msg.sender;
            
        }

The execution Cost : 2086 . 

>  Hence clearly after mitigation the gas cost is reduced. Approximately its possible to save 9 gas for every iterations

### [G-6] USAGE OF UINTS/INTS SMALLER THAN 32 BYTES (256 BITS) INCURS OVERHEAD

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size

(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html)

Each operation involving a uint8 costs an extra 22-28 gas (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type uint8) as compared to ones involving uint256, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the uint8, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed
